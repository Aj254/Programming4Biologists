# Introduction to Programming for Biologists

Lecture workspace for the MSc Bioinformatics at Pwani University. Here is an outline of what we will learn in this course:

1. Introduction to Computing and Computational thinking: Lecture
2. A lecture on Open science and reproducible research (lecture used in my open science project)
2. Introduction to Git and GitHub for version control: Hands-on session
3. Introduction to Linux on the command line:
      - Basic commands: Rik's page commands live coding
      - Dive deeper to Linux and scripting: lecture materials from IBT (Amel's page)
      - Setting up a reproducible Bioinformatics project workspace
4. Python for Bioinformatics: Cover the introductory materials on Python
      - Setting up and working with Python on IDLE console and the various text editors we can use
      - Setting up Jupyter Notebooks and the conda environment
      - Go through the materials on the Jupyter Notebooks starting from introduction all the way to Biopython but we do not cover the section on Object-Oriented programming
5. Time permitting, we can introduce R programming basics

### Projects
During this course, you will work on a python programming project, in which you will get to utilize the newfound skills, and learn even more by doing. I will use GitHub classroom for this part since the students will be required to submit their work via GitHub. 

### Assignments
The notebooks are infused with programming exercises on genomic data. 


### Teaching approach

We will use a lot of live coding in class, and very few lectures. I will, however, provide some reference text for a deeper grasp of the programming concepts. My focus will be to teach the thinking behind computing. How to turn a biological problem to a computational problem, and solve it using bash scripting or Python. The focus is on thinking.
